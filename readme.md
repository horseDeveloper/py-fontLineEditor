# Script info
## Script summary:
1) This script can search for 'namerecord nameID' and/or 'target index'. 
2) After the first match, line by line, you can (keep/delete/edit) the line.

## Script notes
### Why edit here? 
Fonts can be very big and Notepad does not handle scrolling/editing very well.
    
### Why edit `namerecord`? 
So that your custom font has the appropriate `Copyright/Author/...`

 ### Why remove lines after a certain `lookup index`? 
So you can freeze just the alternative features (glyphs) you want and remove the other substitutions of the (lookup index) set.
